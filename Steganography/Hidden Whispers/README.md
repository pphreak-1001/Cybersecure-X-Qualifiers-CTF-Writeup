### Writeup:

So the provided file was a corrupt PNG file whose PNG and IHDR chunk was missing. 

I used pngcheck and hexeditor to fix the image and got the flag:

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€lsd-KingdomIntact)-[~]
â””â”€# file data
data: data

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€lsd-KingdomIntact)-[~]

```

The IEND chunk made me realise that it should be an image file.
