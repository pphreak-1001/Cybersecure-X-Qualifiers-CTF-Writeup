### Solution

I spent a lot of time searching for Suryansh's hostname using different dorks but eventually the solution turned out to be way simpler than i thought.

Use yandex search engine and search Suryansh Deshwal.

You will find his medium article where he has uploaded his PC's screenshot containing the hostename
